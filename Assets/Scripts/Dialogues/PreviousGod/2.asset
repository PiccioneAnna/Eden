  - 'I see you found the shrine.  '
  - 'Look at you. Quick learner.  '
  - "The place you\u2019re going to enter soon is called Purgatory.  "
  - 'It serves as a link between here and the human world.  '
  - "Traverse the gates to step your shoes into some else\u2019s life.  "
  - 'Explore the worlds as much as you like, but be careful getting attached to the
    residents  '
  - 'Eventually all things come to an end.  '
  - "In the human world you\u2019ll retain all of your god given abilities, but do
    be careful. Humans get scared at the idea of the unknown. "
  - "I\u2019ll give you this in case anything happens. It grants you the ability
    to teleport back to \u2018______\u2019 at any time. "
  - 'Best of luck friend. '
